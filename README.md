# Tutu test

This is my solved test task for [Tutu.ru's vacancy](https://github.com/tutu-ru-mobile/internship_test). For data I took [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co)'s pokemon lists. Great service!
I used MVC architecture, worked with multiple Threads via LiveData and Executors and maintain local database with Room.
That was very interesting exercise!
